Scripts to quickly install applications on Ubuntu based systems

This is my collection of automated setup scripts for applications that require PPAs, dependencies, need to be installed as a suite, or require post install configuration.

As a general rule these have been tested, but each one is based on the bash history of a manual installation, so... User beware.
